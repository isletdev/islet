# Decisions log

Short record of decisions that shape the code. Newest at the bottom. Each entry: what was decided, why, and what it rules out.

## 2026-09-10 — Product name: Islet
Chosen after four naming rounds. Registry lookups on that date showed `islet.dev`, `islet.sh` and `islet.run` unregistered. GitHub org will be `isletdev`. Binaries: `isletd` (daemon), `islet` (CLI).

## 2026-09-10 — Open source first, paid later
Ship the complete single-server panel under AGPL-3.0 through v1.0 and build a user base before any paid work. Pro design is captured in `VISION.md` section 4 and `REPOS_AND_MONETIZATION.md` but nothing paid is scheduled.

## 2026-09-10 — Daemon language: Go
Single static binary, low memory on cheap VPSes, native Docker SDK, easy `curl | sh` install, arm64 for free. Rules out a Node or Bun runtime on the server.

## 2026-09-10 — Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
Static single-page app embedded in the Go binary via `embed.FS`. Tailwind and shadcn/ui for components. Chosen over Next.js because the panel needs no server-side rendering and must add zero runtime cost on the box. Rules out any Node process on the server for the panel.

## 2026-09-10 — Resource budget
The panel must stay usable on a 1 vCPU, 2 GB VPS with 30 containers. Targets: daemon under 60 MB RSS idle, UI bundle under 1 MB gzipped, no background CPU above 1% when idle. These numbers are goals for phase 0 and gates for v1.0.

## 2026-09-10 — Legal owner: Torsten Labs DOO
Torsten Labs DOO, North Macedonia (https://torstenlabs.com) owns the copyright, trademark and domains. The CLA names Torsten Labs DOO as the licensee. Billing provider must accept sellers in North Macedonia; verify Paddle or Lemon Squeezy eligibility before any paid work.

## 2026-09-10 — Scale-out not scheduled
Design captured in `VISION.md` section 3.18. Not on the roadmap.

## 2026-09-10 — Server id on machine-bound records from the first migration
Every table that describes something running on a machine (containers, app copies, processes, metrics, cron runs, logs, backups runs) carries a `server_id` column from the first migration, always the local server's id for now. Cheap today, avoids rewriting every table and query if scale-out (`VISION.md` section 3.18) is ever built. This is a schema convention only; no multi-server behaviour is scheduled.

## 2026-09-10 — Brand: Islet visual identity v2 (v1 rejected)
v1 (split-disc mark, lowercase wordmark, teal and sand palette, "Your own little island") was rejected as soft and generic. v2: abstract geometric mark, a square with its corner piece set apart; wordmark "Islet" in Geist 600; black and white palette with one blue accent for links and focus only; Geist and Geist Mono, both SIL OFL, self-hosted; tagline "Own your infrastructure." References: Vercel, Linear, Raycast for finish, Tailscale and Cloudflare for trust. Guidelines in `brand/README.md`, tokens in `brand/tokens/`.

## 2026-09-10 — Website: static, separate repo, Astro
The marketing site and legal pages are static content, so no Next.js: static HTML is the best SEO and adds no runtime. Plan: Astro in a separate public repo (`isletdev/website`), deployed to Cloudflare Pages, legal pages as Markdown routes, fonts self-hosted. A single-file sample in the v2 brand lives outside the core repo at `../islet-website/index.html`; its legal texts are drafts and must be reviewed by a lawyer and completed with the company's registration details before publishing.
